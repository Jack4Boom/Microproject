        <h1 id = "Home">General Infos about Black magic 2</h1>

        <p>Black Magic II: Phantom's Causatum, or simply Black Magic II, is a Roblox fighting game by QQ Studios inspired by several fighting games.</p>

        <p>There are currently 6 classes: Assailant, Avalon, Kurai, Virtue, Citadel and Revenant</p>

        <h2>Roles</h2>

        <p>
            Roles are specific, pre-ordained playstyles for classes. With one word, a role summarizes how a class are meant to engage the enemy in battle. 
            While not mandatory, it is recommended that the player closely follow their class's role in battle, as every class is developed to fulfill this role as efficiently and as accurately as possible. 
            Hybrid classes can also bear multiple roles -- their Main role, and their subsequent Subrole(s).
        </p>
        
        <h2>Rushdown</h2>
            
        <p>A Rushdown is heavily focused on closing the distance between them and the enemy. 
            Classes with the Rushdown role are often equipped with numerous means to apply pressure, and to prevent the enemy from escaping. 
            This includes high walkspeed, fast-acting attacks, attacks that apply the (-) Movement decreased debuff, or even scarier, all three simultaneously. However, their high offensive potential often results in little defensive potential in return. 
            Because of this, rushdowns are weak against sturdy opponents that do not need to escape, such as Tanks.
            <strong>Example is the class Kurai.</strong>
        </p>

        <h2>Zoner</h2>

        <p>A Zoner is heavily focused on maintaining distance between them and the enemy. 
            Classes with the Zoner role often have movesets with far-reaching pokes, projectiles, and AoE, making them great at neutral. 
            This means that they lack safe or fast close-ranged moves and have fragile HP, making them terrible against mobile classes like rushdowns, 
            but their pokes and far-reaching attacks make them great to those with little mobility, such as tanks and grapplers.
            <strong>Example is the class Virtue.</strong>
        </p>

        <h2>Tank</h2>

        <p>
            A Tank is heavily focused on outlasting the enemy through high survivability and defense. 
            Classes with the Tank role are almost always granted above-average Health <strong>(>1000 HP)</strong>, and often have numerous Super Armored attacks at their disposal. 
            However, they are also handicapped by low walkspeed and little to no means of escape. 
            Because of this, tanks are naturally weak to enemies with a high focus on ranged combat and zero obligation to approach, such as Zoners.
            <strong>Example is the class Citadel.</strong> 
        </p>

        <h2>Duellist</h2>

        <p>
            A Duelist, otherwise known as a shoto, or all-rounder is heavily focused on one-on-one combat. 
            Classes with the Duelist role have answers to any situation, and can play out any role, but their moveset is mostly comprised of single-target attacks. 
            Because of this, duelists are weak against fighting multiple opponents, and most Duelists usually do not excel at offense nor defence. 
            <strong>Example is the class Assailant.</strong> 
        </p>

        <br></br>
        <h1>Game mechanics</h1>

        <h2>Neutral</h2>

        <p>
            Neutral is the natural state of combat, where neither player is being subjected to a combo and both players are actively trying to engage the other. 
            During neutral, neither player is at a disadvantage in spacing or frame data.
        </p>

        <h2>Scaling</h2>

        <p>
            Scaling is the gradual decrease of damage dealt during a combo until it maximizes at a certain damage cap. 
            The amount of damage possible is dependent on the letter grade of scaling assigned to the combo's starting attack.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            There are five grades of Scaling: 
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>D Scaling (1000 maxmimum damage)</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>C Scaling (600 maximum damage)</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>B Scaling (400 maximum damage)</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>A Scaling (300 maximum damage)</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>A+ Scaling (150 maximum damage)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Combo Timer</h2>

        <p>
            The Combo Timer is a mechanic that instigates a time limit for a combo in order to prevent infinites. 
            When a combo is running out of time, a golden bubble will appear on the victim with a message saying "COMBO ABOUT TO DROP". 
            The bubble will begin shrinking until it disappears, upon which the opponent will gain iFrames and wakeup automatically. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The time limit for a combo depends on the scaling of its starting attack as follows:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>A+ Scaling: 9 seconds</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>A Scaling: 15 seconds</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>B Scaling: 20 seconds</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>C Scaling: 26 seconds</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
            <li>D Scaling: 30 seconds</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Punishing</h2>

        <p>
            A punish is the art of penalizing the opponent for leaving themselves vulnerable, being predicted, or otherwise making a mistake.
        </p>

        <h2>Super Armour</h2>

        <p>
            Super Armor is an attack property that allows the player to take damage without being inflicted with hitstun. There are 3 lvls of super armour.
        </p>

        <h2>Guard Break</h2>

        <p>
            Guardbreak is the player's primary attack against a blocking opponent. If the opponent does't Brace it will break through the shield and the enemy gets a hitstun.
        </p>

        <h2>Blocking</h2>

        <p>
            Blocking is the primary form of defense. 
            By holding the Guard key, the player will enter a defensive stance and summon a white, spherical Shield around themself. 
            When attacked, they will be pushed back and take no damage, being dealt a fraction of the attack's raw damage to Shield Health instead. 
            While blocking, the player can jump. Releasing Block has small endlag, which can be counterhit. Blocking can by bypassed by crushes. 
        </p>

        <h2>Bracing</h2>

        <p>
            Bracing is when both the back key (S for 3D, A for 2D) and the Block button at the same time. While it is immune to normal attacks and crushes, it can be bypassed by sweeps. 
        </p>

        <h2>Heat</h2>

        <p>
            Heat is the primary resource gathered during combat. When a player either receives or deals damage, they will generate a small amount of Heat. However, dealing damage rewards more Heat than being damaged.
            This resource is consumed primarily by Universal Skills and EX Specials, but can also be required by other attacks depending on the class (e.g. Avalon H.AC, Kurai JH.AC, etc). The player can store a maximum of 6 bars of Heat.
            Heat gained, similarly to damage, is scaled down incrementally during combos. This means that attacks used later in a combo will generate less heat than attacks used towards the beginning.
        </p>

        <h2>Specials</h2>

        <p>
            Specials are eight moves unique to each class that help define their playstyle. Each special has a separate cooldown, and by default are accessed with their respective numbered hotkeys (SP1 hotkey is 1 by default, etc.).
            In the in-game settings, it is possible to set the keybinds for these moves as a keystroke, a featured mechanic in the original Black Magic.
            EX Specials
            An EX Special is a synonymous term for SP7 and SP8, which are reserved for a class's "ultimates", or strongest attacks. They have a minimum cost of 3 bars of Heat and typically have very large cooldowns. 
        </p>

        <h2>Modifiers</h2>

        <p>
            Modifiers are two keybinds that allow the player to, as the name suggests, modify an attack. Modified attacks will behave differently when performed.
            To modify an attack, hold the Modifier 1 key (F by default) or the Modifier 2 key (G by default), then press the hotkey for the attack you wish to modify.
            For example, Avalon SP1 will normally fire three bullets as projectiles in a forward, horizontal lane. However, if Mod1 is held before SP1 is performed, 
            Avalon will instead fire his bullets 45 degrees upwards, hitting airborne opponents. The same can be done by holding Mod2, in which case Avalon will instead fire his bullets at the floor, hitting knockdowned opponents.
